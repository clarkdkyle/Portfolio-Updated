                <p>Throughout my professional career the majority of my time was used engaging with nerds do nerd things. I love video games, comic books, board games, and movies. Along with being a normal nerd, I'm also a cow-nerd;
                  I enjoy taking care of my family cattle and horses. I am still very much a nerd whether it's herding cattle and putting out hay or playing video games. I realized how much I enjoyed these things when I would get off work to either play games like Stardew Valley to take care of my digital farm animals, or go outside and take care of the real ones. 
                  I spent most of my roaring twenties running an all in one nerd hobby shop called Game Nut Entertainment, that specialized in movies, video games, board games, card games, and comic books.
                  One of the things I heard most while running the store was how unique it was and how many people wished they had a similar company where they are from.
                  What I want most out of this career is to help make collectible nerd culture an easier thing for other geeks as consumers to be a part of and enage with eachother. 
                  It was often surprsing and frustrating how difficult it was to find websites and applications that would properly organize/catagorize comic books or movie inventories with pricing and the ability to trade in or resell.
                  That is a gap I hope to learn how to fill.
