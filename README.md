# portfolio

This is the README file for my portfolio
I have 3 pages. First page for my about me section. Second for my Contact. Third for my Portfolio.
The nav bar is a dropdown button that can link to the other 3 pages.

I have edited my pages to fix the white space appearing on the right side of my pages.

My portfolio is able to respond to different size screens and different size devices.
